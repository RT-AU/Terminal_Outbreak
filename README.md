Terminal Outbreak is a short, text-based zombie wave survival game inspired by "The Last Stand." Made for the 19-27th April Text Jam (https://itch.io/jam/text-jam-2), it runs entirely in the terminal.

Your goal is to survive for 25 days until a rescue team finds you, or you can try to fix the helicopter out back and escape the city that way.  Fortunately, these zombies only rise at night, so during the day you can salvage for supplies, upgrade your base, purchase new weapons, and even hire allies to aid you in your survival.

The game was programmed in C# using .NET 8 over the course of roughly one week and won 2nd place in the game jam.
